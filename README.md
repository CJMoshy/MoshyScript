# MoshyScript

- This is moshyScript. I made this for fun over a day or two. It doesnt do much,
  but it was a cool excercise to learn about how interpreted programming
  languages function.

# Usage

- moshyScript supports declaration of integer variables with two keywords (mut &
  imut), although imut doesnt inforce immutability yet.
- lang also supports basic mathematic ops (+ - * /)
- check out MS.ts for an example of how to use the lang!
